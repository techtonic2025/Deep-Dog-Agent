State Definitions and Pydantic Schemas for Research Agent

This module defines the state objects and structured schemas used for
the research agent workflow, including researcher state management and output schemas.

Merged schema (CP4): ResearcherState/ResearcherOutputState now hold the union
of the production pipeline's fields (search_queries, curated_sources,
start_time, tool_call_iterations) and the platform agent engine's fields
(output/report modes, depth caps, curation dicts).

Semantics:
- agent_type now means the PLATFORM (e.g. "reddit", "pubmed", "web").
  The old production meaning ("research" / "discovery") moved to the
  `discovery` boolean flag.
- Each engine invocation gets its own private ResearcherState instance, so
  curation dicts (articles_read, saved_articles, findings_log) never
  cross-contaminate between concurrent runs.
