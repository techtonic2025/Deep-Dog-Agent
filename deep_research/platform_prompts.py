STRUCTURE:
- Use clear headings and subheadings.
- Cover the sources; integrate their key findings into the narrative.
- Include specific data points, quotes, and insights from the material.
- Do NOT fabricate or add information not present in the sources.
- Write in a professional, analytical tone.

CITATIONS (critical):
- BEFORE writing the report body, output a <CitationPlanList> block at the very
  start. List every source you plan to cite with its pre-assigned [N] number,
  full title, and URL — copied exactly from the <Curated Sources> list.
- Keep the [N] numbering EXACTLY as assigned in the <Curated Sources> list.
  Do NOT renumber, reassign, or skip numbers.
- In the report body, cite sources INLINE using the [N] numbers, immediately
  after each fact or claim, e.g. "...costs about $20/month [3]."
- To cite several sources for one claim, use [1][2] or [1, 2].
- Use ONLY source numbers that exist in the <Curated Sources> list (1 through
  the highest number shown). Never invent a number that isn't in the list.
- DO NOT write a "## Sources" section — the sources list with the correct URLs
  will be added automatically after your response.
- DO NOT include URLs or markdown links anywhere in your response body.

Remember: output the <CitationPlanList> first, then the report body with inline
[N] citations. A ## Sources section with the correct URLs will be appended for you.
